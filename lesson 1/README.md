# Lesson 1 - Github and an Intro to Java

##  Github

### Ideas behind a perfect repo

#### 1. What should the master branch contain?
Working and well-tested code that has been reviewed by peers.

#### 2. Non-master branches?
1. Each of these branch should mostly have one (maybe two if you are pair-programming a feature) person working on it. 
2. Each branch should add a significant working change to the master. Usually each branch adds a working feature to the master. Occassionally you will have a small bug that can be fixed in a few lines of code. Simply branch off master, make the change, and open a pull request to merge your fix.

#### 3. Issues:
1. Labels:
![labels](images/labels.png)
Every time you notice a bug, add it to the issues with the label “bug”. Whenever you/team decide to add a new features, enhancements can be used. You can use labels to prioritize certain fixed. You can also assign people to issues so that teammates don’t step into each other’s work. You can see what your teammates are working on.

2. Milestones:
![milestones](images/milestones.png)
Use this to properly scope your project and to make sure that your team is on track.

#### 4. Pull Requests:
1. An extra checkpoint in merging a branch to master (or other branches)
2. Peers can look at the changes a merge will add and get a chance to review/comment on/ask questions about the code
3. Peers can (and should) checkout the branch to test it out before merging.

#### 5. Merge Conflicts:
Working in a relatively large project with multiple other people will result in merge conflicts. It happens when the same line of code has been changed on master in your branch. Merge conflicts might look something like this:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
public static int methodName(int a, int b) {
=======
public static int otherName(int a, int b) {
>>>>>>> featureBranch
  // body
}
```
What does it all mean? The code between <<<<<<< HEAD and ======= is the code that lives in master. And the code between ======= and >>>>>>> featureBranch is the code that lives in your branch. In order to solve this, look at what version is outdated. Remove that code section along with the <<<<, ====, and >>>> lines. Now, `git add` the files with merge conflicts. After that, you should have no problem after that to merge your branch to master.

#### 6. .gitignore
When you start collaborating on Android projects, you will start noticing how certain files from your Android project mess things up in other people's computers. There are some files that you never want to push to the repo. It can be hard to manually add certain files while keeping out others. .gitignore helps us here by never tracking any changes in that file. Usually, .gitignore contains certain extensions but it can also contain folders and specific filenames.

Here is a .gitignore you can use for your Android projects:

```
# Built application files
*.apk
*.ap_

# Files for the ART/Dalvik VM
*.dex

# Java class files
*.class

# Generated files
bin/
gen/
out/

# Gradle files
.gradle/
build/

# Local configuration file (sdk path, etc)
local.properties

# Proguard folder generated by Eclipse
proguard/

# Log Files
*.log

# Android Studio Navigation editor temp files
.navigation/

# Android Studio captures folder
captures/

# Intellij
*.iml
.idea/workspace.xml

# Keystore files
*.jks
```     

### Best Practices:
1.  Commits: Each commit should add a working part of the feature to the branch. 
2.  *Commit often* and write proper commit messages. The idea behind commit messages is that if a stranger/instructor reads through all the commits and commit messages, they should be able to understand how the project progressed. Example of a commit message: `“ADD: Sign-in form skeleton”`, `“EDIT: Subscribe button color/shape”`
3.  Pull Requests: After you are satisfied with the work done in your branch, you might want merge it into master. To do this, pull requests are used. Once you have created a pull request, your peers should review the changes you made and ask questions about parts they don’t understand. A pull-request should only be merged after n number of peers have reviewed the code and given it a :+1:. Your team can decide how exactly you want that to happen.
4.  (Highly recommended) Issues to track bugs/assign tasks to team members as well as to write down future goals

## Java

### Getting started with Android Studio

We will be using Android Studio as our IDE, even though (for this class) we won't actually be creating an Android app.

1. Create a new Android Studio Project
2. Name it (something?)
3. Select Phone and Tablet, API 15 (This doesn't really matter for now)
4. Empty Activity
5. Finish

This will create a basic Android application skeleton for you. We won't be using the skeleton, so we'll create our own Module.

1. Click File > New > Module.
2. Select Java Library and click Next.
3. For Java class name, use "HelloWorld". Click Finish.
4. You should now see a Java module (in a folder with whatever name you gave it) inside your Android project.

### Hello World

Copy paste into `HelloWorld.java` and read over the following code:

```java
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }

}
```

A window button should appear next to the main method header. Click it to run your program!

```
Hello World!
```

Don't worry too much yet about what all the words in `public static void main(String[] args)` mean. For now, just remember that this is the **main method**, and that every java program must have a main method defined. This main method is what the Java Virtual Machine runs initially, and all subsequent code eventually stems from the main method.

### `Account` and `MoneySaver`

#### Classes

Create two new classes, and copy paste the following boilerplates into them:

```
public class MoneySaver {

    private long myMoney;
    private Account myAccount;
    private String name;


    public MoneySaver(String name, long money) {
        this.name = name;
        myMoney = money;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public Account getMyAccount() {
        return myAccount;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return name + ", " + "My balance is: "+ myMoney;
    }

    public void deposit(int amount) {
    }

    public void withdraw(int amount) {
    }
    
    public void signUpForChecking(int amount) {
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
}

```

```
public class Account {

    private MoneySaver owner;
    private long amount;

    public String toString() {
        return "Account owner: " + owner.getName() + ", Account Balance: $" + amount;
    }

    public static Account largerAccount(Account acc1, Account acc2) {
    }

}

```

##### Constructors

The constructor is a special method used to initialize instances of your class (just like Python's `__init__` method). Classes by default inherit a no-argument constructor from the default `Object` class. That means that even without epxlicitly defining a constructor, we can already initalize an `Account`:

```Account a = new Account() // This works!```

Often, you will want to initialize your object with some values. In this case you must define your own constructor.

**Go ahead and implement the `Account` constructor. It should have input arguments `long amount, MoneySaver owner`**

#### Fields

You'll notice both classes also have fields. Fields are either attributes of members of a class (an `amount` describes an `Account`) or things that belong to the class (an `Account` has an `owner`). **Fields should almost exclusively be `private` unless you have a *really* good reason to make it `public`.** If you want an outside class to be able to access a field, you must create public getter/setter methods.

**Define and implement the `getAmount` and `setAmount` methods in `Account`. Make sure they have appropriate return types and input arguments.**

Add the following to your main method (`public static void main(String[] args)`) to test your code so far:

```
MoneySaver jim = new MoneySaver("Jim", 100);
Account a = new Account(100, jim);
System.out.println(a);
a.setAmount(20);
System.out.println("New amount: " + a.getAmount());
```

Expected output:

```
Account owner: Jim, Account Balance: $100
New amount: 20
```

#### Methods

These classes also have methods, which are things instances can "do". Each method must specify what it returns, (`void` if nothing). Generally speaking methods are `public`. However, you might find yourself writing a `private` method that nothing outside the class should be able to see. Often, "helper" methods are `private`.

**implement `deposit` in `Account`.**

Test your code:

```
MoneySaver jim = new MoneySaver("Jim", 100);
Account a = new Account(100, jim);
System.out.println(a);
a.setAmount(20);
a.deposit(10);
System.out.println("New amount: " + a.getAmount());
```

```
Account owner: Jim, Account Balance: $100
New amount: 30
```

##### What does `static` mean?

`static` methods operate on the *Class*, as opposed to *instances* of the class. You can call static methods without creating any object e.g. `Collections.sort()`. Make a method `static` if the method is something the *Class* can do.

**Implement `largerAccount` in `Account`**

Test your implementation!

```
MoneySaver jim = new MoneySaver("Jim", 100);
MoneySaver bob = new MoneySaver("Bob", 200);
Account small = new Account(20, jim);
Account big = new Account(30, bob);
System.out.println(Account.largerAccount(small, big));
```

```
Account owner: Bob, Account Balance: $30
```

#### Inheritance

##### `extends`

**Define a class `CheckingAccount` that `extends` from `Account`.** CheckingAccount now has all of the methods that `Account` does. **Give it a constructor with a similar signature to `Account`'s construtor.** If you need help implementing the constructor, check out [this](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/super.html) website.

**Give your `CheckingAccount` a `withdraw` method.** This function should properly update the account balance.

Finally, you are ready for your `MoneySaver` to be able to sign up for a checking account. **Implement `signUpForChecking`, ensuring you properly modify and initialize the `MoneySaver's` fields.**

Realize that you can store a `CheckingAccount` instance in `myAccount` without changing its type from `Account`! This is an example of *polymorphism*. Because a `CheckingAccount` *is an* `Account`, you can store `CheckingAccount`s in `Account`s.

Note that you can't do it the other way around. Try putting this code in your project:

```
CheckingAccount specific = new Account(100, new MoneySaver("Bill", -20)); // Incompatible types error
```

This is because `CheckingAccount` is the specific subclass, and `Account` is the general `superclass`.

**Give your `MoneySaver` a `withdraw` method.** You will have to [cast](http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/12/what-is-type-casting-in-java-class-interface-example.html) `myAccount` to a `CheckingAccount` in order to call its `withdraw` method. This is because `Account`s don't have `withdraw` methods, only `CheckingAccount`s do. You have to explicitly tell Java that the account is a `CheckingAccount` to call `withdraw`.

Test your code from this section:

```
MoneySaver jim = new MoneySaver("Jim", 100);
jim.signUpForChecking(30);
CheckingAccount acc = (CheckingAccount) jim.getMyAccount();
System.out.println(jim);
System.out.println(acc);
jim.deposit(40);
System.out.println(jim);
jim.withdraw(60);
System.out.println(jim);
System.out.println(acc);
```

```
Jim, My balance is: 70
Account owner: Jim, Account Balance: $30
Jim, My balance is: 30
Jim, My balance is: 90
Account owner: Jim, Account Balance: $10
```

##### Abstraction

The last thing we will learn about inheritance is the `abstract` keyword. The `abstract` keyword goes in the class declaration (`public abstact class...`). This keyword does two things:

* You can now declare `abstract` methods. These methods have no body, but classes that extend them must define these methods. For example, let's say you had an abstract `Vehicle` class:

```
public abstract class Vehicle {

    int wheels;
	
	public Vehicle(int wheels) {
        this.wheels = wheels;
	}

    public int getWheels() {
        return wheels;
    }

	public abstract void turnOn();
}
```

This says that all classes `extend`ing `Vehicle` must implement `turnOn`. Why doesn't Vehicle implement `turnOn`? Well, what a vehicle must do to turn on depends on what kind of vehicle it is! The implementation would be quite difficult for a `Car` as opposed to a `Boat`. (Boats turn on, right?)

Note that the `Car` and `Boat` classes would both have the inhereted method `getWheels()`, so you wouldn't have to implement it repetitively in each subclass.

* You can no longer initialize instances of the `abstract` class. Using the above example:

```
public class Car extends Vehicle {
	public void turnOn() {
		...
	}
}
Vehicle v = new Vehicle(); // This doesn't work.
Vehicle v = new Car(); // This works!
v.turnOn(); // This works because all Vehicles have a turnOn method.
Car c = new Car(); // This works too.
c.turnOn();
```

**Make your `Account` class `abstract`. Confirm that you can't initalize it anymore.**


# The `Fraction` class

Create a new class called `Fraction`.

```
public class Fraction {

    private int numerator;
    private int denominator;

    public String toString() {
        return Integer.toString(numerator) + "/" + Integer.toString(denominator);
    }

}
```

#### Implement a constructor

In the arguments, have numerator come first.

#### `gcd`

Give your `Fraction` a `gcd` function, which returns the greatest common diviser of two integers. The function should have the following header:

```
public static int gcd(int m, int n)
```

and **should work if `n > m`, and vice-versa**.

There's a pretty sweet recursive algorithm for `gcd` called *Euclid's Algorithm* which states that the `gcd(a, b)` is:

```
// This function assumes a>b. Your's should not!
function gcd(a, b)
    If b is 0:
        return a
    Else:
        return gcd(b, a mod b)
```

Why does it make sense for `gcd` to be `static`? If you're not sure, ask a peer or an instructor.

#### `simplify`

Give your `Fraction` a `simplify` function, which simplifies the fraction. We leave it up to you to determine the proper method header. 

#### `add`

Give your `Fraction` a `add` function, which add the other fraction by this fraction, and returns the simplified result. *This function should not modify either fraction*. You shouldn't change the [Access Modifiers](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_access_modifiers.htm) to the `numerator` and `denomenator` fields (they should be private).

## Test your functions

Create a new class called `FractionTester`. Copy-paste the following code into it. All the tests should pass:

```
public class FractionTester {

    public void runTests() {
        Fraction f1 = new Fraction(10,20);
        Fraction f2 = new Fraction(2,3);
        System.out.println(f1.add(f2) + " = 7/6");
        System.out.println(f1 + " = 10/20");
        System.out.println(f2 + " = 2/3");
        f1.simplify();
        System.out.println(f1 + " = 1/2");
        System.out.println(Fraction.gcd(9, 2) + " = 1");
        System.out.println(Fraction.gcd(24, 18) + " = 6");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FractionTester tester = new FractionTester();
        tester.runTests();
    }
}

```

# Animal Farm

1. Define an abstract class `Animal`. Animals have a number of `legs`, a `name`, a `color`, a `species`, and a `weight`.
2. Implement a constructor for the Animal class.
3. Implement getter and setter methods for each field using the `getFieldName()` `setFieldName()` naming convention. (Android Studio can do this automatically for you very quickly.)
4. Define the abstract method `grow()`.
5. Define the `Animal` subclasses `Cat`, `Dog`, `Cow`. Each should have a constructor with input arguments `(name, color)`. Have cats and dogs' weights be initalized randomly between 0-25, and cows 100-200.
6. Make the `grow` method in `Cat` multiply its weight by 3, in `Dog` by 1.5, and in `Cow` by 5.
7. Define a class `Farm`. A farm should have an `ArrayList` of `Animal`s.
8. Define `getHeaviestAnimals()` in `Farm`, which returns a new (don't modify the underlying ArrayList) sorted ArrayList.
9. Define `printCatNames()`, which prints each cat's name to a new line in the console.
10. Define `averageLegs()`, which returns the average number of legs amongst the animals in the farm.
