# Lesson 0 - Getting prepared

Welcome to [insert class name here]! We're excited to be with you this semester, and in order to have a smoother process there are a few things that we'd like you to do before coming in to class on September 1st.

## 1. Download Android Studio

If you do this before class we'll have a lot more time to help you out and get started! Please download Android Studio 2.x [link here].

*Note*: For those of you who already have Android Studio, it's important that you have the latest version. This makes it easier for us to help you with any problems you might have.
*Note 2*: If you choose to use Android Studio on Windows, then you'll need to download github desktop [link here].

## 2. Set up your github account with Android Studio

Click some buttons, enter your account name, and voila! Git integration! Super useful. If you don't have a git account... make one!

## 3. Join our slack channel

If you need any help, posting in slack will enable the promptest response and allow you to see any solutions to similar problems other people have had. Do it!
