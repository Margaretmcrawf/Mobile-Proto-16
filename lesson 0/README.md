# Lesson 0 - Getting prepared

Welcome to MobileProto! We're excited to be with you this semester, and in order to have a smoother process there are a few things that we'd like you to do before coming in to class on September 1st.

## Install Ubuntu 14.04

This is the recommended OS for this course. If you don't already have Ubuntu on your computer either via dual-boot or a VM, we strongly recommend you to install it. You can use Windows or OSX, but if you have OS-specific issues it will be more difficult for the teaching team to help you.

## 1. Download and Install Android Studio

If you do this before class we'll have a lot more time to help you out and get started! Please download [Android Studio 2.1](https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html).

*Note*: For those of you who already have Android Studio, it's important that you have the latest version. This makes it easier for us to help you with any problems you might have.
*Note 2*: If you choose to use Android Studio on Windows, then you'll need to download github desktop [link here].

## 2. Set up github

Put your github acocunt name on [this]() spreadsheet. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) our repo to your account. Finally, clone the repository and add our's as a remote named `upstream`:

```
cd some_directory  # wherever you want to store your MobileProto repo
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME/Mobile-Proto-16.git  # this should be the ssh clone address given to you by github
git remote add upstream git@github.com:MobileProto16/Mobile-Proto-16.git
```

As an aside, Android studio has git-integration. Be on the lookout for this. It's pretty cool.

## 3. Join our slack channel

If you need any help, posting in slack will enable the promptest response and allow you to see any solutions to similar problems other people have had. Do it!
